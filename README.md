### LLM for Large-Scale Optimization Model Auto-Formulation: A Lightweight Few-Shot Learning Approach

#### Project Overview
Large-scale optimization is a key backbone in modern business decision-making. However, the process of building these models is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. We address this by proposing a multi-agent framework LEAN-LLM-OPT, which takes a query (a problem description and associated datasets) as input and orchestrates a team of LLM agents to output the optimization formulation. LEAN-LLM-OPT innovatively applies few-shot learning to teach LLM agents how they could effectively apply reasoning and customized tools to build optimization models in our benchmark Large-scale-or and a Singapore Airlines choice-based revenue management use case.
